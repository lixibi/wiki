Chapter 11. Interfaces: from protocols to ABCs
***********************************************

*抽象类代表了一个接口[85].
— Bjarne Stroustrup Creator of C++*  

Interfaces are the subject of this chapter: from the dynamic protocols that are the hallmark of duck typing to ABCs (Abstract Base Classes) that make interfaces explicit and verify implementations for conformance.  

接口是本章的主题：动态协议是鸭子类型到能够明确接口并验证一致性执行的ABC(抽象基类)的标志性记号。  

If you have a Java, C# or similar background, the novelty here is in the informal protocols of duck typing. But for the long-time Pythonista or Rubyist, that is the “normal” way of thinking about interfaces, and the news is the formality and type-checking of ABCs. The language was 15 years old when ABCs were introduced in Python 2.6.  

假如你拥有Java，C#或者类型的背景，让你感到新奇的是非正式的鸭子类型协议。不过对于Python的长期支持者和Ruby支持者来说，这只是一种思考接口的再“普通”不过方式罢了，对他们来说所谓新的内容便是形式上的ABC类型检查。当这门语言15岁的时候，ABC被引入到了Python2.6。  

We’ll start the chapter reviewing how the Python community traditionally understood interfaces as somewhat loose—in the sense that a partially implemented interface is often acceptable. We’ll make that clear through a couple examples that highlight the dynamic nature of duck typing.  

本章我们将回顾Python社区在传统上意义上所理解的接口是如何在部分实现接口时失去意义还经常让人接受。我们会透过几个专门高亮标注的自然动态鸭子类型来搞清楚这个问题。  

Then, a guest essay by Alex Martelli will introduce ABCs and give name to a new trend in Python programming. The rest of the chapter will be devoted to ABCs, starting with their common use as superclasses when you need to implement an interface. We’ll then see when an ABC checks concrete subclasses for conformance to the interface it defines, and how a registration mechanism lets developers declare that a class implements an interface without subclassing. Finally, we’ll see how an ABC can be programmed to automatically “recognize” arbitrary classes that conform to its interface—without subclassing or explicit registration.  

然后是一篇由Alex Martelli编写的随笔，它介绍了ABC，并按照Python编程的趋势起了个名字。本章余下的内容将专门用来介绍ABC，当你有实现一个接口的需求时可以将它们作为超类这个常用方法开始。之后我们会看到当一个ABC对接口所定义的一致性进行具体子类检查时，如何注册一种机制让开发者来实现类接口而不用进行子类话。最后，我们将看到一个ABC如何被编写为自动地“认出”任意的符合无接口子类化的类，或者如何被明确的注册。  

We will implement a new ABC to see how that works, but Alex Martelli and I don’t want to encourage you to start writing your own ABCs left and right. The risk of over-engineering with ABCs is very high.  

我们会实现一个新的ABC以观察它的工作原理，但是哪一个方面来说我和阿历克斯－马爹利都不鼓励你去编写自己都ABC。

>#### 警告
ABCs, like descriptors and metaclasses, are tools for building frameworks. Therefore, only a very small minority of Python developers can create ABCs without imposing unreasonable limitations and needless work on fellow programmers.  

>ABC和描述器和元类一样都是构建框架的工具。因此，只有很少的一部分Python开发者能够创建ABC而不会强加的不合理限制以及对同行编程人员对不必要工作。  

>Let’s get started with the Pythonic view of interfaces.
>我们就从Python化的接口角度讲起。  

## Python文化中的接口与协议

Python在ABC引入之前就已经很成功了，而且大多数已经存在的代码根本用不到它们。因此在第一章我们就讨论过了鸭子类型和协议。`协议与鸭子类型`协议都被定义为使多态工作在Python这样的动态类型语言中。  


接口在动态类型语言中是如何工作的？首先，其基本原理是：即使在语言中不使用接口关键字，并且忽略掉ABC，每一个类也都会拥有一个接口：公共属性的实现或者被其他类继承。这会包含像`__getitem__`或者`__add__`这样的特殊方法。  

通过定义，被保护的私有属性就不是接口的一部分了，即使“保护”仅仅是声明约定（以单下划线开头），私有属性也可以被轻易地访问（回想下Python中的私有与“保护”属性）。这是避免这些约定的不好的方式。  

换句话来说，一个对象的接口拥有公共属性并不是一件可耻的事情，因为，如果有必要，数据属性能够总是转换为一个特性以实现getter/setter逻辑，而不用中断使用普通`obj.attr`语法的客户端代码。我们在类`Vector2d`中实现此操作：在例子11-1中我们看到利用公共的`x`和`y`属性的首次实现。  

例子11-1.vector2d_v0.py：x和y是公共数据属性（同样的代码也出现在例子9-2）。

```python
class Vector2d:
    typecode = 'd'

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = float(x)
        self.y = float(y)

    def __iter__(self):
        return (i for i in (self.x, self.y))

    # 下面还有更多的方法（此清单中被省略）
```

之后我们把例子9-7中的`x`和`y`转换为只读属性（例子11-2）。这不但是一次重要的重构，而且Vector2d接口的基础部分也未改变：用户仍旧可以读取`my_vector.x`和`my_vector.y`。  

例子11-2. vector2d_v3.py: x和y作为属性被重新实现（参见例子9-9中的完整清单）。  

```python
class Vector2d:
    typecode = 'd'

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.__x = float(x)
        self.__y = float(y)

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self.__x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self.__y

    def __iter__(self):
        return (i for i in (self.x, self.y))

    # 下面还有更多的方法（此清单中被省略）
```

接口的有用的补充定义是：一个对象的公共方法的子集能够在系统扮演一个特定的角色。这就是在Python文档中提到的“类文件对象”或者“可迭代的”，而无需指定一个类时所应用到东西。接口可以看作是方法的一个集合，它用来扮演Smalltalk程序员口中所提到`协议`这个角色，而且此术语被扩散到了其他的动态语言社区。协议是独立的继承。一个类可以实现多种协议，能够让类自身的实例去扮演多种角色。  

协议是一种接口，但是因为它们是非正式的——仅在文档或者约定中被定义——这样协议是不能够强制像正式接口那样使用。协议可以通过特殊类部分地实现，这样也不错。有时候，所有的特定的API

As I write this, the Python 3 documentation of memoryview says that it works with objects that “support the buffer protocol”, which is only documented at the C API level. The bytearray constructor accepts an “an object conforming to the buffer interface”. Now there is a move to adopt “bytes-like object” as a friendlier term[86]. I point this out to emphasize that “X-like object”, “X protocol” and “X interface” are synonyms in the minds of Pythonistas.  

One of the most fundamental interfaces in Python is the sequence protocol. The interpreter goes out of its way to handle objects that provide even a minimal implementation of that protocol, as the next section demonstrates.  

## Python的查询顺序
Python数据模型的哲学就是尽量地与基本协议相配合。当它称为序列时，Python努力地尝试以最简单的实现来运行。  

图片：略
  

图11-1.UML类图片展示了ABC序列，以及来自`collections.abc`相关抽象类。继承的箭头从子类指向它的超类。斜体的名字是抽象方法。  

图表11-1演示了正式的`Sequence`接口是如何定义为一个ABC的。现在，让我们来看下例子11-3中的列`Foo`。它并没有继承自`abc.Sequence`，它只是实现了序列协议的的一个方法：`__getitem__` (`__len__` 方法丢失)

例子11-3.部分序列协议利用`__getitem__`实现：足够多的项访问，迭代以及`in`运算符。  

```python
>>> class Foo:
...     def __getitem__(self, pos):
...         return range(0, 30, 10)[pos]
...
>>> f = Foo()
>>> f[1]
10
>>> for i in f: print(i)
...
0
10
20
>>> 20 in f
True
>>> 15 in f
False
```

这里还没有方法`__iter__`，`Foo`实例可以迭代是因为——回调——当Python看到`__getitem__`方法就会尝试通过调用从0开始的整数索引方法来迭代对象。因此Python对于迭代`Foo`实例足够的聪明，即使`Foo`没有`__contains__`方法它也可以让`in`运算符运行：它就会执行完全扫描以检查项是否存在。  

总的来说，序列协议的重要性就是，在`__iter__`和`__contains__`不存在的情况下，Python仍旧可以管理以迭代，而且通过调用`__getitem__`使`in`运算符运行。  

我们的第一章中的原始`FrenchDeck`也不是由`abc.Sequence`子类化而来，但是它却实现了序列协议的两个方法：`__getitem__`和`__len__`。参见例子11-4.  

例子11-4.deck作为纸牌的一个序列（等同于例子1-1）。  

```python
import collections

Card = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])

class FrenchDeck:
    ranks = [str(n) for n in range(2, 11)] + list('JQKA')
    suits = 'spades diamonds clubs hearts'.split()

    def __init__(self):
        self._cards = [Card(rank, suit) for suit in self.suits
                                        for rank in self.ranks]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._cards)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._cards[position]
```

A good part of the demos in Chapter 1 work because of the special treatment Python gives to anything vaguely resembling a sequence. Iteration in Python represents an extreme form of duck typing: the interpreter tries two different methods to iterate over objects.  



Now let’s study another example emphasizing the dynamic nature of protocols. 

现在，然我们来研究另一个强调动态协议性质的例子。  

Monkey-patching to implement a protocol at run time
The FrenchDeck class from Example 11-4 has a major flaw: it cannot be shuffled. Years ago when I first wrote the FrenchDeck example I did implement a shuffle method. Later I had a Pythonic insight: if a FrenchDeck acts like a sequence, then it doesn’t need its own shuffle method, because there is already random.shuffle, documented as “Shuffle the sequence x in place”.  

猴子补丁在运行时实现协议

>### 提示
When you follow established protocols you improve your chances of leveraging existing standard library and third-party code, thanks to duck typing.   

当你遵守了被认可的协议，你就提高了影响已存在的标准库和第三方库代码的机会，这应该感谢鸭子类型。  

The standard random.shuffle function is used like this:  

标准的random.shuffle用法像这样：  

```python
>>> from random import shuffle
>>> l = list(range(10))
>>> shuffle(l)
>>> l
[5, 2, 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, 4, 0, 6]
```

However, if we try to shuffle a FrenchDeck instance, we get an exception, as in Example 11-5.  

不过，如果我们当我们尝试打乱FrenchDeck实例时会碰到异常，一如例子11-5所示。  

*Example 11-5. random.shuffle cannot handle FrenchDeck.*  

*例子11-5. random.shuffle不能够处理FrenchDeck。*

```python
>>> from random import shuffle
>>> from frenchdeck import FrenchDeck
>>> deck = FrenchDeck()
>>> shuffle(deck)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File ".../python3.3/random.py", line 265, in shuffle
    x[i], x[j] = x[j], x[i]
TypeError: 'FrenchDeck' object does not support item assignment
```

The error message is quite clear: "'FrenchDeck' object does not support item assignment”. The problem is that shuffle operates by swapping items inside the collection, and FrenchDeck only implements the immutable sequence protocol. Mutable sequences must also provide a `__setitem__` method.  

错误信息很明确：“FrenchDeck对象不支持对项的赋值”。问题在于shuffle通过交换集合内部的项实现操作，而FrenchDeck仅实现了不可变序列协议。因此可变序列也必须提供一个`__setitem__`方法。  

Because Python is dynamic, we can fix this at runtime, even at the interactive console. Here is how to do it:  

因为Python时动态的，我们不能够运行是解决这个问题，即使是在交互终端中。下面是解决该问题的做法：  

*Example 11-6. Monkey patching FrenchDeck to make it mutable and compatible with random.shuffle (continuing from Example 11-5)*.  

*例子11-6. 对FrenchDeck实施猴子补丁能够让它可变，并适应random.shuffle（本例子是例子11-5的继续）。*

```python
>>> def set_card(deck, position, card): # 1
...     deck._cards[position] = card
...
>>> FrenchDeck.__setitem__ = set_card   # 2
>>> shuffle(deck)  # 3 
>>> deck[:5]
[Card(rank='3', suit='hearts'), Card(rank='4', suit='diamonds'), Card(rank='4',
suit='clubs'), Card(rank='7', suit='hearts'), Card(rank='9', suit='spades')]
```

1. create a function that takes deck, position and card as arguments.
	创建接受`deck`, `position`和`card`作为参数的函数。  
 
2. assign that function to an attribute named `__setitem__`in the FrenchDeck class.
	将该函数赋值给FrenchDeck类中一个名称为`__setitem__`的属性。  
 
3. `deck` can now be sorted because FrenchDeck now implements the necessary method of the mutable sequence protocol.  
	现在`deck`可以被排列了，因为FrenchDeck实现了可变序列协议的必要方法。  

The signature of the `__setitem__` special method is defined in the Emulating container types section of the Data model chapter of the Python Language Reference. Here we named the arguments deck, position, card—and not self, key, value as in the Language Reference—to show that every Python method starts life as a plain function, and naming the first argument self is merely a convention. This is OK in a console session, but in a Python source file it’s much better to use self, key and value as documented.  

`__setitem__`

The trick is that set_card knows that the deck object has an attribute named _cards, and _cards must be a mutable sequence. The `set_card` function is then attached to the FrenchDeck class as the `__setitem__` special method. This is an example of monkey patching: changing a class or module at run time, without touching the source code. Monkey patching is powerful, but the code that does the actual patching is very tightly coupled with the program to be patched, often handling private and undocumented parts.  

这里的技巧在于set_card知道deck对象拥有一个名称为_cards的属性，而且_cards必须是一个可变序列。然后`set_card`函数附加到 FrenchDeck 类，并当作该类的`__setitem__`特殊方法。这是一个猴子补丁的例子：在运行时改变一个类或是模块，而不用改变源代码。猴子补丁很强大，但是实际的补丁代码和将要打补丁的程序之间结合的非常紧密，因此猴子补丁经常用来处理私有的，没有支持文档的部分代码。  

Besides being an example of monkey patching, Example 11-6 highlights that protocols are dynamic: random.shuffle doesn’t care what type of argument it gets, it only needs the object to implement part of the mutable sequence protocol. It doesn’t even matter if the object was “born” with the necessary methods or if they were somehow acquired later.  

处理作为一个猴子补丁的例子之外，例子11-6还重点指出协议是动态的：random.shuffle不关心自己获取的是何种类型参数，它唯一需要的是对象实现可变序列协议。它甚至不关心对象是否拥有必要的方法，或者以后这些方法以后如何获得。  

The theme of this chapter so far has been “duck typing”: operating with objects regardless of their types, as long as they implement certain protocols.  

目前为止，本章的主题已经覆盖到了“鸭子类型”：操作对象，不论对象是何种类型，只要对象能够实现某些协议就好。  

When we did present diagrams with ABCs, the intent was to show how the protocols are related to the explicit interfaces documented in the abstract classes, but we did not actually inherit from any ABC so far.  

在下一节我们会直接地改变ABC，而不仅仅只是文档而已。  

## 鸭子和ABC
在复习了普通的Python协议类型接口，我们移向ABC。不过在深入例子和详情之前，Alex Martelli用文章解释了为什么是Python最好的附加部分。

>## WATERFOWL AND ABCS 水禽和ABC
>### by Alex Martelli 作者 阿历克斯－马爹利
>I’ve been credited on Wikipedia for helping spread the helpful meme and sound-bite "duck typing“—i.e, ignoring an object’s actual type, focusing instead on ensuring that the object implements the method names, signatures, and semantics, required for its intended use.  

>In Python, this mostly boils down to avoiding the use of isinstance to check the object’s type (not to mention the even worse approach of checking, e.g, whether type(foo) is bar—which is rightly anathema as it inhibits even the simplest forms of inheritance!).  

>The overall duck typing approach remains quite useful in many contexts—and yet, in many others, an often preferable one has evolved over time. And herein lies a tale…  

>In recent generations, the taxonomy of genus and species (including but not limited to the family of waterfowl known as Anatidae) has mostly been driven by phenetics—an approach focused on similarities of morphology and behavior… chiefly, observable traits. The analogy to “duck typing” was strong.  

>However, parallel evolution can often produce similar traits, both morphological and behavioral ones, among species that are actually unrelated, but just happened to evolve in similar, though separate, ecological niches. Similar “accidental similarities” happen in programming, too—e.g, consider the classic OOP example:  

```python
class Artist:
    def draw(self): ...

class Gunslinger:
    def draw(self): ...

class Lottery:
    def draw(self): ...
```

>Clearly, the mere existence of a method called draw, callable without arguments, is far from sufficient to assure us that two objects x and y such that x.draw() and y.draw() can be called are in any way exchangeable or abstractly equivalent—nothing about the similarity of the semantics resulting from such calls can be inferred. Rather, we need a knowledgeable programmer to somehow positively assert that such an equivalence holds at some level!  

>In biology (and other disciplines) this issue has led to the emergence (and, on many facets, the dominance) of an approach that’s an alternative to phenetics, known as cladistics—focusing taxonomical choices on characteristics that are inherited from common ancestors, rather than ones that are independently evolved. (Cheap and rapid DNA sequencing can make cladistics highly practical in many more cases, in recent years).  

>For example, sheldgeese (once classified as being closer to other geese) and shelducks (once classified as being closer to other ducks) are now grouped together within the subfamily Tadornidae (implying they’re closer to each other than to any other Anatidae—sharing a closer common ancestor). Furthermore, DNA analysis has shown, in particular, that the White-winged Wood Duck is not as close to the Muscovy Duck (the latter being a shelduck) as similarity in looks and behavior had long suggested—so the wood duck was reclassified into its own genus, and entirely out of the subfamily!  

>Does this matter? It depends on the context! For such purposes as deciding how best to cook a waterfowl once you’ve bagged it, for example, specific observable traits (not all of them—plumage, for example, is de minimis in such a context :-), mostly texture and flavor (old-fashioned phenetics!), may be far more relevant than cladistics. But for other issues, such as susceptibility to different pathogens (whether you’re trying to raise waterfowl in captivity, or preserve them in the wild), DNA closeness can matter much more…  

>So, by very loose analogy with these taxonomic revolutions in the world of waterfowls, I’m recommending supplementing (not entirely replacing—in certain contexts it shall still serve) good old duck typing with… goose typing!  

>What **goose typing** means is: *isinstance(obj, cls)* is now just fine… as long as cls is an Abstract Base Class—in other words, cls’s metaclass is abc.ABCMeta.  

>You can find many useful existing abstract classes in collections.abc—others yet in the numbers module of the Python Standard Library[87].   

>Among the many conceptual advantages of ABCs over concrete classes (such as, Scott Meyer’s “all non-leaf classes should be abstract”—see Item 33 in his book, More Effective C++), Python’s ABCs add one major practical advantage: the register class method, which lets end-user code “declare” that a certain class becomes a “virtual” subclass of an ABC (for this purpose the registered class must meet the ABC’s method name and signature requirements, and more importantly the underlying semantic contract—but it need not have been developed with any awareness of the ABC, and in particular need not inherit from it!). This goes a long way towards breaking the rigidity and strong coupling that make inheritance something to use with much more caution than typically practiced by most OOP programmers…  

>Sometimes you don’t even need to register a class for an ABC to recognize it as a subclass!  

>That’s the case for the ABCs whose essence boils down to a few special methods. For example:  

```python
>>> class Struggle:
...     def __len__(self): return 23
...
>>> from collections import abc
>>> isinstance(Struggle(), abc.Sized)
True
```

>As you see, abc.Sized recognizes Struggle as “a subclass”, with no need for registration—because implementing the special method named __len__ is all it takes (it’s supposed to be implemented with the proper syntax—callable without arguments—and semantics—returning a non-negative integer denoting an object’s “length”; any code that implements a specially named method, such as __len__, with arbitrary, non-compliant syntax and semantics has much-worse problems anyway :-).
So, here’s my valediction…: whenever you’re implementing a class embodying any of the concepts represented in the ABCs in numbers, collections.abc, or other framework you may be using, be sure (if needed) to subclass it from, or register it into, the corresponding ABC. At the start of your programs using some library or framework defining classes which have omitted to do that, perform the registrations yourself; then, when you must check for (most typically) an argument being, e.g, “a sequence”, check whether:  

```python
isinstance(the_arg, collections.abc.Sequence)
```
3. You can also, of course, define your own ABCs — but I would discourage all but the most advanced Pytho‐ nistas from going that route, just as I would discourage them from defining their own custom metaclasses... and even for said “most advanced Pythonistas”, those of us sporting deep mastery of every fold and crease in the language, these are not tools for frequent use: such “deep metaprogramming”, if ever appropriate, is intended for authors of broad frameworks meant to be independently extended by vast numbers of separate development teams... less than 1% of “most advanced Pythonistas” may ever need that! — A.M.  

>And, don’t define custom ABCs (or metaclasses) in production code… if you feel the urge to do so, I’d bet it’s likely to be a case of “all problems look like a nail”-syndrome for somebody who just got a shiny new hammer—you (and future maintainers of your code) will be much happier sticking with straightforward and simple code, eschewing such depths. Valē!  

Besides coining the “goose typing”, Alex makes the point that inheriting from an ABC is more than implementing the required methods: it’s also a clear declaration of intent by the developer. That intent can also be made explicit through registering a virtual subclass.  

In addition, the use of isinstance and issubclass becomes more acceptable to test against ABCs. In the past these functions worked against duck typing, but with ABCs they become more flexible. After all, if a component does not implement an ABC by subclassing, it can always be registered after the fact so it passes those explicit type checks.  

However, even with ABCs, you should beware that excessive use of isinstance checks may be a code smell—a symptom of bad OO design. It’s usually not OK to have a chain of if/elif/elif with insinstance checks performing different actions depending on the type of an object: you should be using polymorphism for that—i.e. designing your classes so that the interpreter dispatches calls to the proper methods, instead of you hard coding the dispatch logic in if/elif/elif blocks.  

>##### 提示
>There is a common, practical exception to the recommendation above: some Python APIs accept a single str or a sequence of str items; if it’s just a single str, you want to wrap it in a list, to ease processing. Since str is a sequence type, the simplest way to distinguish it from any other immutable sequence is to do an explicit *isinstance(x, str)* check[4].  

>[4]  Unfortunately in Python 3.4 there is no ABC that helps distinguish a str from tuple or other immutable sequences, so we must test against str. In Python 2 the basestr type exists to help with tests like these. It’s not an ABC, but it’s a superclass of both str and unicode, but in Python 3 basestr is gone. Curiously, there is in Python 3 a collections.abc.ByteString type, but it only helps detecting bytes and bytear ray.  

On the other hand, it’s usually OK to perform an insinstance check against an ABC if you must enforce an API contract: “Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me”, as technical reviewer Lennart Regebro put it. That’s particularly useful in systems that have a plug-in architecture. Outside of frameworks, duck typing is often simpler and more flexible than type checks.  

换句话说，如果你必须强制实施一个API约定，那么对一个ABC的实例检查通常不会有问题的：“朋友，如果你想要调用我，你必须实现这个约定。”

For example, in several classes in this book when I needed to take a sequence of items and process them as a list, instead of requiring a list argument by type checking, I simply took the argument and immediately built a list from it: that way I can accept any iterable, and if the argument is not iterable, the call will fail soon enough with a very clear message. One example of this code pattern is in the `__init__` method in Example 11-13, later in this chapter. Of course, this approach wouldn’t work if the sequence argument shouldn’t be copied, either because it’s too large or because my code needs to change it in-place. Then an insinstance(x, abc.MutableSequence) would be better. If any iterable is acceptable, then calling iter(x) to obtain an iterator would be the way to go, as we’ll see in Why sequences are iterable: the iter function.  

Another example is how you might imitate the handling of the `field_names` argument in collections.namedtuple: field_names accepts a single string with identifiers separated by spaces or commas, or a sequence of identifiers. It might be tempting to use isinstance, but Example 11-7 shows how I’d do it using duck typing[89].  

*Example 11-7. Duck typing to handle a string or an iterable of strings*.  

```python
try:   #1
    field_names = field_names.replace(',', ' ').split() #2  
except AttributeError: #3
    pass #4
    field_names = tuple(field_names) #5
```
  
1. Assume it’s a string (EAFP = it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission).
  
2. Convert commas to spaces and split the result into a list of names.
  
3. Sorry, `field_names` doesn’t quack like a str… there’s either no .replace, or it returns something we can’t .split.
  
4. Now we assume it’s already an iterable of names.  

5. To make sure it’s an iterable and to keep our own copy, create a tuple out of what he have.  

Finally, in his essay Alex reinforces more than once the need for restraint in the creation of ABCs. An ABC epidemic would be disastrous, imposing excessive ceremony in a language that became popular because it’s practical and pragmatic. During the Fluent Python review process, Alex wrote:  

*ABCs are meant to encapsulate very general concepts, abstractions, introduced by a framework—things like “a sequence” and “an exact number”. [Readers] most likely don’t need to write any new ABCs, just use existing ones correctly, to get 99.9% of the benefits without serious risk of mis-design.*  

Now let’s see goose typing in practice.  

现在让我们见识一下实际中的鹅类型。  

## Subclassing an ABC 子类化ABC
Following Martelli’s advice we’ll leverage an existing ABC, collections.MutableSequence, before daring to invent our own. In Example 11-8 FrenchDeck2 is explicitly declared a sub-class of collections.MutableSequence.  

Example 11-8. frenchdeck2.py: FrenchDeck2, a subclass of collections.MutableSequence.  

```python
import collections

Card = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])

class FrenchDeck2(collections.MutableSequence):
    ranks = [str(n) for n in range(2, 11)] + list('JQKA')
    suits = 'spades diamonds clubs hearts'.split()

    def __init__(self):
        self._cards = [Card(rank, suit) for suit in self.suits
                                        for rank in self.ranks]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._cards)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._cards[position]

    def __setitem__(self, position, value):  #  self._cards[position] = value

    def __delitem__(self, position):  #  del self._cards[position]

    def insert(self, position, value):  #  self._cards.insert(position, value)
```

__setitem__ is all we need to enable shuffling…  

But subclassing MutableSequence forces us to implement __delitem__, an abstract method of that ABC.  

We are also required to implement insert, the third abstract method of MutableSequence.  

Python does not check for the implementation of the abstract methods at import time (when the frenchdeck2.py module is loaded and compiled), but only at runtime when we actually try to instantiate FrenchDeck2. Then, if we fail to implement any abstract method we get a TypeError exception with a message such as "Can't instantiate abstract class FrenchDeck2 with abstract methods __delitem__, insert". That’s why we must implement __delitem__ and insert, even if our FrenchDeck2 examples to not need those behaviors: the MutableSequence ABC demands them.

Figure 11-2. UML class diagram for the MutableSequence ABC and its superclasses from collections.abc. Inheritance arrows point from subclasses to ancestors. Names in italic are abstract classes and abstract methods.  

As Figure 11-2 shows, not all methods of the Sequence and MutableSequence ABCs are abstract. From Sequence, FrenchDeck2 inherits the ready-to-use concrete methods __contains__, __iter__, __reversed__, index, and count; from MutableSequence, it gets append, reverse, extend, pop, remove, and __iadd__.  

The concrete methods in each collections.abc ABC are implemented in terms of the public interface of the class, so they work without any knowledge of the internal structure of instances.  

>#### 提示
As the coder of a concrete subclass, you may be able to override methods inherited from ABCs with more efficient implementations. For example, __contains__ works by doing a full scan of the sequence, but if your concrete sequence keeps its items sorted, you can write a faster __contains__ that does a binary search using bisect function (see Managing ordered sequences with bisect).  

>To use ABCs well you need to know what’s available. We’ll go over the collections ABCs next.  

## 标准库中的ABC
Since Python 2.6 ABCs are available in the standard library. Most are defined in the collections.abc module, but there are others. You can find ABCs in the numbers and io packages, for example. But the most widely used is collections.abc. Let’s see what is available there.  

**ABCs in collections.abc**  

>#### 提示
There are two modules named abc in the standard library. Here we are talking about collections.abc. To reduce loading time, in Python 3.4 it’s implemented outside of the collections package, in Lib/_collections_abc.py), so it’s imported separately from collections. The other abc module is just abc, i.e. Lib/abc.py, where the abc.ABC class is defined. Every ABC depends on it, but we don’t need to import it ourselves except to create a new ABC.

Figure 11-3. UML class diagram for ABCs in collections.abc.  

Figure 11-3 is a summary UML class diagram (without attribute names) of all 16 ABCs defined in collections.abc as of Python 3.4. The official documentation of collections.abc has a nice table summarizing the ABCs, their relationships and their abstract and concrete methods (called “mixin methods”). There is plenty of multiple inheritance going on in Figure 11-3. We’ll devote most of Chapter 12 to multiple inheritance, but for now it’s enough to say that it is usually not a problem when ABCs are concerned[90].  

Let’s go over the clusters in Figure 11-3:  

`Iterable, Container and Sized`  

Every collection should either inherit from these ABCs or at least implement compatible protocols. Iterable supports iteration with __iter__, Container supports the in operator with __contains__ and Sized supports len() with __len__.  

`Sequence, Mapping and Set`  

These are the main immutable collection types, and each has a mutable subclass. A detailed diagram for MutableSequence is in Figure 11-2; for MutableMapping and MutableSet there are diagrams in Chapter 3 (Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2).  

`MappingView`  

In Python 3, the objects returned from the mapping methods .items(), .keys() and .values() inherit from ItemsView, ValuesView and ValuesView, respectively. The first two also inherit the rich interface of Set, with all the operators we saw in Set operations.  

`Callable and Hashable`  

These ABCs are not so closely related to collections, but collections.abc was the first package to define ABCs in the standard library, and these two were deemed important enough to be included. I’ve never seen subclasses of Callable or Hashable. Their main use is to support the insinstance built-in as a safe way of determining whether an object is callable or hashable[91].  

`Iterator`  

Note that iterator subclasses Iterable. We discuss this further in Chapter 14.
After the collections.abc package, the most useful package of ABCs in the standard library is numbers, covered next.  

**The numbers tower of ABCs**  

The numbers package defines the so called “numerical tower”, i.e. this linear hierarchy of ABCs, where Number is the topmost superclass, Complex is its immediate subclass and so on, down to Integral:  


▪   Number
▪   Complex
▪   Real
▪   Rational
▪   Integral


So if you need to check for an integer, use isinstance(x, numbers.Integral) to accept int, bool (which subclasses int) or other integer types that may be provided by external libraries which register their types with the numbers ABCs. And you or the users of your API may always register any compatible type as a virtual subclass of numbers.Integral to satisfy your check.  

If, on the other hand, a value can be a floating point type, you write isinstance(x, numbers.Real), and your code will be happy to take bool, int, float, fractions.Fraction or any other non-complex numerical type provided by an external library, such as NumPy which is suitably registered.  

>### 警告
Somewhat surprisingly, decimal.Decimal is not registered as a virtual subclass of numbers.Real. The reason is that, if you need the precision of Decimal in your program, then you want to be protected from accidental mixing of decimals with other less precise numeric types, particularly floats.  

>After looking at some existing ABCs, let’s practice goose typing by implementing an ABC from scratch and putting it to use. The goal here is not to encourage everyone to start coding ABCs left and right, but to learn how to read the source code of the ABCs you’ll find in the standard library and other packages.  

## 使用ABC来定义
To justify creating an ABC we need to come up with a context for using it as an extension point in a framework. So here is our our context: imagine you need to to display advertisements in a web site or a mobile app in random order, but without repeating an ad before the full inventory of ads is shown. Now let’s assume we are building an ad management framework called ADAM. One of its requirements is to support user-provided non-repeating random-picking classes[92]. To make it clear to ADAM users what is expected of a “non-repeating random-picking” component, we’ll define an ABC.  

Taking a clue from “stack” and “queue”—which describe abstract interfaces in terms of physical arrangements of objects, I will use a real world metaphor to name our ABC: bingo cages and lottery blowers are machines designed to pick items at random from a finite set, without repeating until the set is exhausted. The ABC will be named Tombola, after the Italian name of bingo and the tumbling container which mixes the numbers[93].  

The Tombola ABC has four methods. The two abstract methods are:  

```
▪   .load(…): put items into the container.
▪   .pick(): remove one item at random from the container, returning it.
The concrete methods are:
▪   .loaded(): return True if there is at least one item in the container.
▪   .inspect(): return a sorted tuple built from the items currently in the container, without changing its contents (its internal ordering is not preserved).
```

Figure 11-4 shows the Tombola ABC and three concrete implementations.

Figure 11-4. UML diagram for an ABC and three subclasses. The name of the Tombola ABC and its abstract methods are written in italics, per UML conventions. The dashed arrow is used for interface implementation, here we are using it to show that TomboList is a virtual subclass of Tombola because it is registered, as we will see later in this chapter[94].  

Example 11-9 shows the definition of the Tombola ABC:  

Example 11-9. tombola.py: Tombola is an ABC with two abstract methods and two concrete methods.  

```python
import abc

class Tombola(abc.ABC):    @abc.abstractmethod
    def load(self, iterable):    """Add items from an iterable."""

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def pick(self):    """Remove item at random, returning it.

        This method should raise `LookupError` when the instance is empty.
        """

    def loaded(self):    """Return `True` if there's at least 1 item, `False` otherwise."""
        return bool(self.inspect())    def inspect(self):
        """Return a sorted tuple with the items currently inside."""
        items = []
        while True:    try:
                items.append(self.pick())
            except LookupError:
                break
        self.load(items)    return tuple(sorted(items))
```

To define an ABC, subclass abc.ABC.  

An abstract method is marked with the @abstractmethod decorator, and often its body is empty except for a docstring[95].  

The docstring instructs implementers to raise LookupError if there are no items to pick.  

An ABC may include concrete methods.  

Concrete methods in an ABC must rely only on the interface defined by the ABC—i.e. other concrete or abstract methods or properties of the ABC.  

We can’t know how concrete subclasses will store the items, but we can build the inspect result by emptying the Tombola with successive calls .pick()…  

…then use .load(…) to put everything back.  

>#### 提示
An abstract method can actually have an implementation. Even if it does, subclasses will still be forced to override it, but they will be able to invoke the abstract method with super(), adding functionality to it instead of implementing from scratch. See the abc module documentation. for details on @abstractmethod usage.  

The .inspect() method in Example 11-9 is perhaps a silly example, but it shows that, given .pick() and .load(…) we can inspect what’s inside the Tombola by picking all items and loading them back. The point of this example is to highlight that it’s OK to provide concrete methods in ABCs, as long as they only depend on other methods in the interface. Being aware of their internal data structures, concrete subclasses of Tombola may always override .inspect() with a smarter implementation, but they don’t have to.  

The .loaded() method in Example 11-9 may not be as silly, but it’s expensive: it calls .inspect() to build the sorted tuple just to apply bool() on it. This works, but a concrete subclass can do much better, as we’ll see.  

Note that our roundabout implementation of .inspect() requires that we catch a LookupError thrown by self.pick(). The fact that self.pick() may raise LookupError is also part of its interface, but there is no way to declare this in Python, except in the documentation (see the docstring for the abstract pick method in Example 11-9.)  

I chose the LookupError exception because of its place in the Python hierarchy of exceptions in relation to IndexError and KeyError, the most likely exceptions to be raised by the data structures used to implement a concrete Tombola. Therefore implementations can raise LookupError, IndexError or KeyError to comply See Example 11-10.  

Example 11-10. Part of the Exception class hierarchy. Complete tree at the Built-in Exceptions page of the Python Standard Library documentation.  

```
BaseException
 ├── SystemExit
 ├── KeyboardInterrupt
 ├── GeneratorExit
 └── Exception
      ├── StopIteration
      ├── ArithmeticError
      │    ├── FloatingPointError
      │    ├── OverflowError
      │    └── ZeroDivisionError
      ├── AssertionError
      ├── AttributeError
      ├── BufferError
      ├── EOFError
      ├── ImportError
      ├── LookupError
      │    ├── IndexError
      │    └── KeyError
      ├── MemoryError
      ... etc.
```

LookupError is the exception we handle in Tombola.inspect.  

IndexError is the LookupError subclass raised when we try to get a item from a sequence with an index beyond the last position.  

KeyError is raised when we use a non-existent key to get an item from a mapping.  

We now have our very own Tombola ABC. To witness the interface checking performed by an ABC, let’s try to fool Tombola with a defective implementation in Example 11-11.  

Example 11-11. A fake Tombola doesn’t go undetected.  

```python
>>> from tombola import Tombola
>>> class Fake(Tombola):  #  ...     def pick(self):
...         return 13
...
>>> Fake  #  <class '__main__.Fake'>
<class 'abc.ABC'>, <class 'object'>)
>>> f = Fake()  #  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Fake with abstract methods load
```

Declare Fake as a subclass of Tombola.  

The class was created, no errors so far.  

TypeError is raised when we try to instantiate Fake. The message is very clear: Fake is considered abstract because it failed to implement load, one of the abstract methods declared in the Tombola ABC.  

So we have our first ABC defined, and we put it to work validating a class. We’ll soon subclass the Tombola ABC, but first we must cover some ABC coding rules.  

#### ABC syntax details ABC的语法细节
The best way to declare an ABC is to subclass abc.ABC or any other ABC.  

申明一个ABC的最好方式就是子类化abc.ABC或者其他的ABC。  

However, the abc.ABC class is new in Python 3.4, so if you are using an earlier version of Python—and it does not make sense to subclass another existing ABC—then you must use the metaclass= keyword in the class statement, pointing to abc.ABCMeta (not abc.ABC). In Example 11-9 we would write:  

不过，abc.ABC类是在Python 3.4中出现的新事物，因此如果你正在使用旧版本的Python。

```python
class Tombola(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    # ...
```

The metaclass= keyword argument was introduced in Python 3. In Python 2, you must use the `__metaclass__` class attribute:  

关键字参数metaclass=在Python中被引入。而在Python 2中你必须使用类属性，`__metaclass__`。  

```python
class Tombola(object):  # this is Python 2!!!
    __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta
    # ...
```

We’ll explain metaclasses in Chapter 21, for now let’s accept that a metaclass as a special kind of class, and agree that an ABC is a special kind of class; for example, “regular” classes don’t check subclasses, so this is a special behavior of ABCs.  

我们将在21章说明元类，我们暂时可以把元类当作是一种特殊的类，并把ABC也当作一种特殊的类；例如“普通”类不回检查子类，因此这就是ABC的一种特殊行为。  

Besides the @abstractmethod, the abc module defines the @abstractclassmethod, @abstractstaticmethod and @abstractproperty decorators. However, these last three are deprecated since Python 3.3, when it became possible to stack decorators on top of @abstractmethod, making the others redundant. For example, the preferred way to declare an abstract class method is:  

除了@abstractmethod之外，abc模块还定义了装饰器@abstractclassmethod，@abstractstaticmethod 和@abstractproperty。不过这最后的三个装饰起从Python 3.3起已被移除了。例如，我们首先的申明一个类方法的方式可以是这样：  

```python
class MyABC(abc.ABC):
    @classmethod
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def an_abstract_classmethod(cls, ...):
        pass
```

>#### 警告
The order of stacked function decorators usually matters, and in the case of @abstractmethod the documentation is explicit:  

>When abstractmethod() is applied in combination with other method descriptors, it should be applied as the innermost decorator, …[96]
In other words, no other decorator may appear between @abstractmethod and the def statement).  

Now that we got these ABC syntax issues covered, let’s put Tombola to use by implementing some full-fledged concrete descendants of it.  

#### 子类化抽象基类Tombola
Given the Tombola ABC, we’ll now develop two concrete subclasses that satisfy it’s interface. These classes were pictured in Figure 11-4, along with the virtual subclass to be discussed in the next section.  

The BingoCage class in Example 11-12 is a variation of Example 5-8 using a better randomizer. This BingoCage implements the required abstract methods load and pick, inherits loaded from Tombola, overrides inspect and adds `__call__`.  

Example 11-12. bingo.py: BingoCage is a concrete subclass of Tombola.  

```python
import random

from tombola import Tombola


class BingoCage(Tombola):    def __init__(self, items):
        self._randomizer = random.SystemRandom()    self._items = []
        self.load(items)    def load(self, items):
        self._items.extend(items)
        self._randomizer.shuffle(self._items)    def pick(self):    try:
            return self._items.pop()
        except IndexError:
            raise LookupError('pick from empty BingoCage')

    def __call__(self):    self.pick()
```

This BingoCage class explicitly extends Tombola.  

Pretend we’ll use this for online gaming. random.SystemRandom implements the random API on top of the os.urandom(…) function which provides random bytes “suitable for cryptographic use” according to the os module docs.  

Delegate initial loading to the .load(…) method.  

Instead of the plain random.shuffle() function, we use the .shuffle() method of our SystemRandom instance.  

pick is implemented as in Example 5-8.  

__call__ is also from Example 5-8. It’s not needed to satisfy the Tombola interface, but there’s no harm in adding extra methods.  

BingoCage inherits the expensive loaded and the silly inspect methods from Tombola. Both could be overridden with much faster, one-liners, as in Example 11-13. The point is: we can be lazy and just inherit the sub-optimal concrete methods from an ABC. The methods inherited from Tombola are not as fast as they could be for BingoCage, but they do provide correct results for any Tombola subclass that correctly implements pick and load.  

Example 11-13 shows a very different but equally valid implementation of the Tombola interface. Instead of shuffling the “balls” and popping the last, LotteryBlower pops from a random position.  

Example 11-13. lotto.py: LotteryBlower is a concrete subclass that overrides the inspect and loaded methods from Tombola.  

```python
import random

from tombola import Tombola


class LotteryBlower(Tombola):

    def __init__(self, iterable):
        self._balls = list(iterable)    def load(self, iterable):
        self._balls.extend(iterable)

    def pick(self):
        try:
            position = random.randrange(len(self._balls))    except ValueError:
            raise LookupError('pick from empty BingoCage')
        return self._balls.pop(position)    def loaded(self):    return bool(self._balls)

    def inspect(self):    return tuple(sorted(self._balls))
```

The initializer accepts any iterable: the argument is used to build a list.
   
The random.randrange(…) function raises ValueError if the range is empty, so we catch that and throw LookupError instead, to be compatible with Tombola.
   
Otherwise the randomly selected item is popped from self._balls.
   
Override loaded to avoid calling inspect (as Tombola.loaded does in Example 11-9). We can make it faster by working with self._balls directly—no need to build a whole sorted tuple.  

Override inspect with one-liner.  

Example 11-13 illustrates an idiom worth mentioning: in __init__, self._balls stores list(iterable) and not just a reference to iterable (i.e. we did not merely assign iterable to self._balls). As mentioned before[97], this makes our LotteryBlower flexible because the iterable argument may be any iterable type. At the same time, we make sure to store its items in a list so we can pop items. And even if we always get lists as the iterable argument, list(iterable) produces a copy of the argument, which is a good practice considering we will be removing items from it and the client may not be expecting the list of items she provided to be changed[98].  

We now come to the crucial dynamic feature of goose typing: declaring virtual subclasses with the register method.  

#### A virtual subclass of Tombola
An essential characteristic of goose typing—and the reason why it deserves a waterfowl name—is the ability to register a class as a virtual subclass of an ABC, even if it does not inherit from it. When doing so, we promise that the class faithfully implements the interface defined in the ABC—and Python will believe us without checking. If we lie, we’ll be caught by the usual runtime exceptions.  

This is done by calling a register method on the ABC. The registered class then becomes a virtual subclass of the ABC, and will be recognized as such by functions like issubclass and isinstance, but it will not inherit any methods or attributes from the ABC.  

#### 警告
Virtual subclasses do not inherit from their registered ABCs, and are not checked for conformance to the ABC interface at any time, not even when they are instantiated. It’s up to the subclass to actually implement all the methods needed to avoid runtime errors.  

The register method is usually invoked as a plain function (see Usage of register in practice), but it can also be used as a decorator. In Example 11-14 we use the decorator syntax and implement TomboList, a virtual subclass of Tombola depicted in Figure 11-5.  

TomboList works as advertised, and the doctests that prove it are described in How the Tombola subclasses were tested.  

Figure 11-5. UML class diagram for the TomboList, a real subclass of list and a virtual subclass of Tombola.  

Example 11-14. tombolist.py: class TomboList is a virtual subclass of Tombola.  
```python
from random import randrange

from tombola import Tombola

@Tombola.register  #  class TomboList(list):  #  def pick(self):
        if self:  #  position = randrange(len(self))
            return self.pop(position)  #  else:
            raise LookupError('pop from empty TomboList')

    load = list.extend  #  def loaded(self):
        return bool(self)  #  def inspect(self):
        return tuple(sorted(self))

# Tombola.register(TomboList)  #  
```

Tombolist is registered as a virtual subclass of Tombola.  

Tombolist extends list.  

Tombolist inherits __bool__ from list, and that returns True if the list is not empty.  

Our pick calls self.pop, inherited from list, passing a random item index.  

Tombolist.load is the same as list.extend.  

loaded delegates to bool`footnote:[The same trick I used with `load doesn’t work with loaded, because the list type does not implement __bool__, the method I’d have to bind to loaded. On the other hand, the bool built-in function doesn’t need __bool__ to work, it can also use __len__. See Truth Value Testing in the Built-in Types documentation.].  

If you’re using Python 3.3 or earlier, you can’t use .register as a class decorator. You must use standard call syntax.  

Note that because of the registration, the functions issubclass and isinstance act as if TomboList is a subclass of Tombola:  

```python
>>> from tombola import Tombola
>>> from tombolist import TomboList
>>> issubclass(TomboList, Tombola)
True
>>> t = TomboList(range(100))
>>> isinstance(t, Tombola)
True
```

However, inheritance is guided by a special class attribute named __mro__—the Method Resolution Order. It basically lists the class and its superclasses in the order Python uses to search for methods[99]. If you inspect the __mro__ of TomboList, you’ll see that it lists only the “real” superclasses: list and object.  

```pyhton
>>> TomboList.__mro__
(<class 'tombolist.TomboList'>, <class 'list'>, <class 'object'>)
```

Tombola is not in Tombolist.__mro__, so Tombolist does not inherit any methods from Tombola.  

As I coded different classes to implement the same interface, I wanted a way to submit them all to the same suite of doctests. The next section shows how I leveraged the API of regular classes and ABCs to do it.  

## 子类Tombola是如何被测试的
The script I used to test the Tombola examples uses two class attributes that allow introspection of a class hierarchy:  

```python
__subclasses__()
```

Method that returns a list of the immediate subclasses of the class. The list does not include virtual subclasses.  

```python
_abc_registry
```

Data attribute—available only in ABCs—that is bound to a WeakSet with weak references to registered virtual subclasses of the abstract class.  

To test all Tombola subclasses, I wrote a script to iterate over a list built from Tombola.__subclasses__() and Tombola._abc_registry, and bind each class to the name ConcreteTombola used in the doctests.  

A successful run of the test script looks like this:  

```python
$ python3 tombola_runner.py
BingoCage        23 tests,  0 failed - OK
LotteryBlower    23 tests,  0 failed - OK
TumblingDrum     23 tests,  0 failed - OK
TomboList        23 tests,  0 failed - OK
```

The test script is Example 11-15 and the doctests are in Example 11-16.  

Example 11-15. tombola_runner.py: test runner for Tombola subclasses.  

```python
import doctest

from tombola import Tombola

# modules to test
import bingo, lotto, tombolist, drum    TEST_FILE = 'tombola_tests.rst'
TEST_MSG = '{0:16} {1.attempted:2} tests, {1.failed:2} failed - {2}'


def main(argv):
    verbose = '-v' in argv
    real_subclasses = Tombola.__subclasses__()    virtual_subclasses = list(Tombola._abc_registry)    for cls in real_subclasses + virtual_subclasses:    test(cls, verbose)


def test(cls, verbose=False):

    res = doctest.testfile(
            TEST_FILE,
            globs={'ConcreteTombola': cls},    verbose=verbose,
            optionflags=doctest.REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE)
    tag = 'FAIL' if res.failed else 'OK'
    print(TEST_MSG.format(cls.__name__, res, tag))    if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    main(sys.argv)
```

Import modules containing real or virtual subclasses of Tombola for testing.  

__subclasses__() lists the direct descendants that are alive in memory. That’s why we imported the modules to test, even if there is no further mention of them in the source code: to load the classes into memory.  

Build a list from _abc_registry (which is a WeakSet) so we can concatenate it with the result of __subclasses__().  

Iterate over the subclasses found, passing each to the test function.  

The cls argument—the class to be tested—is bound to the name ConcreteTombola in the global namespace provided to run the doctest.  

The test result is printed with the name of the class, the number of tests attempted, tests failed and an 'OK' or 'FAIL' label.  

The doctest file is Example 11-16.  

Example 11-16. tombola_tests.rst: doctests for Tombola subclasses.  

```
==============
Tombola tests
==============

Every concrete subclass of Tombola should pass these tests.


Create and load instance from iterable::

    >>> balls = list(range(3))
    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola(balls)
    >>> globe.loaded()
    True
    >>> globe.inspect()
    (0, 1, 2)


Pick and collect balls::

    >>> picks = []
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> picks.append(globe.pick())


Check state and results::

    >>> globe.loaded()
    False
    >>> sorted(picks) == balls
    True


Reload::

    >>> globe.load(balls)
    >>> globe.loaded()
    True
    >>> picks = [globe.pick() for i in balls]
    >>> globe.loaded()
    False


Check that `LookupError` (or a subclass) is the exception
thrown when the device is empty::

    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola([])
    >>> try:
    ...     globe.pick()
    ... except LookupError as exc:
    ...     print('OK')
    OK


Load and pick 100 balls to verify that they all come out::

    >>> balls = list(range(100))
    >>> globe = ConcreteTombola(balls)
    >>> picks = []
    >>> while globe.inspect():
    ...     picks.append(globe.pick())
    >>> len(picks) == len(balls)
    True
    >>> set(picks) == set(balls)
    True


Check that the order has changed and is not simply reversed::

    >>> picks != balls
    True
    >>> picks[::-1] != balls
    True

Note: the previous 2 tests have a *very* small chance of failing
even if the implementation is OK. The probability of the 100
balls coming out, by chance, in the order they were inspect is
1/100!, or approximately 1.07e-158. It's much easier to win the
Lotto or to become a billionaire working as a programmer.

THE END
```

This concludes our Tombola ABC case study. The next section addresses how the register ABC function is used in the wild.  

## 注册器的是实际用法
In Example 11-14 we used Tombola.register as a class decorator. Prior to Python 3.3, register could not be used like that—it had to be called as plain function after the class definition, as suggested by the comment at the end of Example 11-14.  

However, even if register can now be used as a decorator, it’s more widely deployed as a function to register classes defined elsewhere. For example, in the source code for the collections.abc module, the built-in types tuple, str, range and memoryview are registered as virtual subclasses of Sequence like this:  

```python
Sequence.register(tuple)
Sequence.register(str)
Sequence.register(range)
Sequence.register(memoryview)
```

Several other built-in types are registered to ABCs in _collections_abc.py. Those registrations happen only when that module is imported, which is OK because you’ll have to import it anyway to get the ABCs: you need access to MutableMapping to be able to write isinstance(my_dict, MutableMapping).  

We’ll wrap up this chapter explaining a bit of ABC magic that Alex Martelli performed in Waterfowl and ABCs.  

## 鹅的行为也可以像鸭子
In his `Waterfowl and ABCs` essay, Alex shows that a class can be recognized as a virtual subclass of an ABC even without registration. Here is his example again, with an added test using issubclass:  

在Alex的论文`水禽和ABC`，他向我们展示了即便没有注册，一个类也可以被当作ABC的虚拟子类。

```python
>>> class Struggle:
...     def __len__(self): return 23
...
>>> from collections import abc
>>> isinstance(Struggle(), abc.Sized)
True
>>> issubclass(Struggle, abc.Sized)
True
```

Class `Struggle` is considered a subclass of `abc.Sized` by the issubclass function (and, consequently, by isinstance as well) because abc.Sized implements a special class method named `__subclasshook__`. See Example 11-17.  

*Example 11-17. Sized definition from the source code of Lib/_collections_abc.py (Python 3.4).*  

通过使用函数issubclass，类`Struggle`被认为是`abc.Sized`的一个子类（所以，使用isinstance的结果也是如此），因为`abc.Sized`实现了一个名称为`__subclasshook__`的特殊方法。详情参见例子11-17。  

*例子 11-17。 Lib/_collections_abc.py中Sized的源代码定义。*    

```python
class Sized(metaclass=ABCMeta):

    __slots__ = ()

    @abstractmethod
    def __len__(self):
        return 0

    @classmethod
    def __subclasshook__(cls, C):
        if cls is Sized:
            if any("__len__" in B.__dict__ for B in C.__mro__): # 1  
            	  return True  # 2
        return NotImplemented  # 3
```

1. If there is an attribute named `__len__` in the `__dict__` of any class listed in `C.__mro__` (i.e. C and its superclasses)…  
  
   如果在`C.__mro__`（例如，C和其自身的超类）中的任何一个类的`__dict__`中存在一个名称为`__len__`的属性  。

2. …return True, signaling that C is a virtual subclass of Sized.  
	返回True，发出一个C拥有Sized虚拟子类的信号。  

3. Otherwise return NotImplemented to let the subclass check proceed.  
	否则返回 NotImplemented ，并让子类继续检查。  

If you are interested in the details of the subclass check, see the source code for the `ABCMeta.__subclasscheck__` method in Lib/abc.py. Beware: it has lots of ifs and two recursive calls.  

如果你对子类检查的细节感兴趣，可以参考Lib/abc.py中的方法 `ABCMeta.__subclasscheck__`。要注意的是：它拥有很多的if语句和两个递归调用。  

The `__subclasshook__` adds some duck typing DNA to the whole goose typing proposition. You can have formal interface definitions with ABCs, you can make isinstance checks everywhere, and still have a completely unrelated class play along just because it implements a certain method (or because it does whatever it takes to convince a `__subclasshook__` to vouch for it). Of course, this only works for ABCs that do provide a `__subclasshook__`.  

`__subclasshook__`添加了一些鸭子类型的DNA到整个鹅类型提案中。利用ABC你可以实现正式的接口定义，你可以在任何地方进行实例检查，

Is it a good idea to implement __subclasshook__ in our own ABCs? Probably not. All the implementations of __subclasshook__ I’ve seen in the Python source code are in ABCs like Sized that declare just one special method, and they simply check for that special method name. Given their “special” status, you can be pretty sure that any method named __len__ does what you expect. But even in the realm of special methods and fundamental ABCs, it can be risky to make such assumptions. For example, mappings implement __len__, __getitem__ and __iter__ but they are rightly not considered a subtype of Sequence, because you can’t retrieve items using an integer offset and they make no guarantees about the ordering of items—except of course for OrderedDict, which preserves the insertion order, but does support item retrieval by offset either.  

For ABCs that you and I may write, a __subclasshook__ would be even less dependable. I am not ready to believe that any class Spam that implements or inherits load, pick, inspect and loaded is guaranteed to behave as a Tombola. It’s better to let the programmer affirm it by subclassing Spam from Tombola, or at least registering: Tombola.register(Spam). Of course, your __subclasshook__ could also check method signatures and other features, but I just don’t think its worthwhile.  

## 本章总结
The goal of this chapter was to travel from the highly dynamic nature of informal interfaces—called protocols—visit the static interface declarations of ABCs, and conclude with the dynamic side of ABCs: virtual subclasses and dynamic subclass detection with `__subclasshook__`.  

本章的目标是

We started the journey reviewing the traditional understanding of interfaces in the Python community. For most of the history of Python, we’ve been mindful of interfaces, but they were informal like the protocols from Smalltalk, and the official docs used language such as “foo protocol”, “foo interface”, and “foo-like object” interchangeably. Protocol-style interfaces have nothing to do with inheritance; each class stands alone when implementing a protocol. That’s how interfaces look like when you embrace duck typing.  

我们开始了旅程

With Example 11-3 we observed how deeply Python supports the sequence protocol. If a class implements `__getitem__` and nothing else, Python manages to iterate over it, and the in operator just works. We then went back to the old FrenchDeck example of Chapter 1 to support shuffling by dynamically adding a method. This illustrated monkey patching and emphasized the dynamic nature of protocols. Again we saw how a partially implemented protocol can be useful: just adding `__setitem__` from the mutable sequence protocol allowed us to leverage a ready-to-use function from the standard library: random.shuffle. Being aware of existing protocols let’s us make the most of the rich Python Standard library.  

Alex Martelli then introduced the term “goose typing[100]" to describe a new style of Python programming. With “goose typing”, ABCs are used to make interfaces explicit and classes may claim to implement an interface by subclassing an ABC or by registering with it—without requiring the strong and static link of an inheritance relationship.  

然后，Alex Martelli引入了属于“鹅类型”来描述了Python编程中的新类型。

The FrenchDeck2 example made clear the main drawbacks and advantages of explicit ABCs. Inheriting from abc.MutableSequence forced us to implement two methods we did not really need: insert and `__delitem__`. On the other hand, even a Python newbie can look at a FrenchDeck2 and see that it’s a mutable sequence. And, as bonus, we inherited eleven ready-to-use methods from abc.MutableSequence (five indirectly from abc.Sequence).  

After a panoramic view of existing ABCs from collections.abc in Figure 11-3, we wrote an ABC from scratch. Doug Hellmann, creator of the cool PyMOTW.com (Python Module of the Week) explains the motivation:
By defining an abstract base class, a common API can be established for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially useful in situations where someone less familiar with the source for an application is going to provide plug-in extensions…[101]  

Putting the Tombola ABC to work, we created three concrete subclasses: two inheriting from Tombola, the other a virtual subclass registered with it. All passing the same suite of tests.  

To close the chapter, we mentioned how several built-in types are registered to ABCs in the collections.abc module so you can ask isinstance(memoryview, abc.Sequence) and get True, even if memoryview does not inherit from abc.Sequence. And finally we went over the `__subclasshook__` magic which lets an ABC recognize any unregistered class as a subclass, as long as it passes a test that can be as simple or as complex as you like—the examples in the Standard Library merely check for method names.  

In conclusion, I’d like to restate Alex Martelli’s admonition that we should refrain from creating our own ABCs, except when we are building user-extensible frameworks—which most of the time we are not. On a daily basis, our contact with ABCs should be subclassing or registering classes with existing ABCs. Less often than subclassing or registering, we might use ABCs for isinstance checks. And even more rarely—if ever—we find occasion to write a new ABC from scratch.  

After 15 years of Python, the first abstract class I ever wrote that is not a didactic example was the Board class of the Pingo project. The drivers that support different single board computers and controllers are subclasses of Board, thus sharing the same interface. In reality, although conceived and implemented as an abstract class, the pingo.Board class does not subclass abc.ABC as I write this[102]. I intend to make Board an explicit ABC eventually—but there are more important things to do in the project.  

Here is a fitting quote to end this chapter:  

`Although ABCs facilitate type checking, it’s not something that you should overuse in a program. At its heart, Python is a dynamic language that gives you great flexibility. Trying to enforce type constraints everywhere tends to result in code that is more complicated than it needs to be. You should embrace Python’s flexibility[103].
— David Beazley and Brian Jones Python Cookbook 3ed.`

Or, as technical reviewer Leonardo Rochael wrote: “If you feel tempted to create a custom ABC, please first try to solve your problem through regular duck-typing”.  

## 深入阅读
Beazley & Jones’ Python Cookbook, 3e (O’Reilly, 2013) has a section about defining an ABC (recipe 8.12). The book was written before Python 3.4, so they don’t use the now preferred syntax when declaring ABCs by subclassing from abc.ABC instead of using the metaclass keyword. Apart from this small detail, the recipe covers the major ABC features very well, ends with the valuable advice quoted at the end of the previous section.  

The Python Standard Library by Example (Addison-Wesley, 2011), by Doug Hellmann, has a chapter about the abc module. It’s also available on the web in Doug’s excellent PyMOTW—Python Module of the Week. Both the book and the site focus on Python 2, therefore adjustments must be made if you are using Python 3. And for Python 3.4, remember that the only recommended ABC method decorator is @abtractmethod—the others were deprecated. The other quote about ABCs in the chapter summary is from Doug’s site and book.  

When using ABCs, multiple inheritance is not only common but practically inevitable, because each of the fundamental collection ABCs—Sequence, Mapping and Set—extends multiple ABCs (see Figure 11-3). Therefore, Chapter 12 is an important follow-up to this one.  

PEP 3119—Introducing Abstract Base Classes gives the rationale for ABCs, and PEP 3141 - A Type Hierarchy for Numbers presents the ABCs of the numbers module.  

For a discussion of the pros and cons of dynamic typing, see Guido van Rossum’s interview to Bill Venners in Contracts in Python: A Conversation with Guido van Rossum, Part IV.  

The zope.interface package provides a way of declaring interfaces, checking whether objects implement them, registering providers and querying for providers of a given interface. The package started as a core piece of Zope 3, but it can and has been used outside of Zope. It is the basis of the flexible component architecture of large scale Python projects like Twisted, Pyramid and Plone. Lennart Regebro has an great introduction to zope.interface in A Python component architecture. Baiju M wrote an entire book about it: A Comprehensive Guide to Zope Component Architecture.  

#### SOAPBOX 演讲台
Type hints  

Probably the biggest news in the Python world in 2014 was that Guido van Rossum gave a green light to the implementation of optional static type checking using function annotations, similar to what the Mypy checker does. This happened in the Python-ideas mailing-list on August 15. The message is Optional static typing—the crossroads. The next month, PEP 484 - Type Hints was published as a draft, authored by Guido.  

The idea is to let programmers optionally use annotations to declare parameter and return types in function definitions. The key word here is “optionally”. You’d only add such annotations if you want the benefits and constraints that come with them, and you could put them in some functions but not in others.
On the surface this may sound like what Microsoft did with with TypeScript, their JavaScript superset, except that TypeScript goes much further: it adds new language constructs (e.g. modules, classes, explicit interfaces etc.), allows typed variable declarations and actually compiles down to plain JavaScript. As of this writing (September, 2014), the goals of optional static typing in Python are much less ambitious.  

To understand the reach of this proposal, there is a key point that Guido makes in the historic August 15, 2014, e-mail:  

```
I am going to make one additional assumption: the main use cases will be linting, IDEs, and doc generation. These all have one thing in common: it should be possible to run a program even though it fails to type check. Also, adding types to a program should not hinder its performance (nor will it help :-).
```

So, it seems this is not such a radical move as it seems at first. PEP 482 - Literature Overview for Type Hints is referenced by PEP 484 - Type Hints, and briefly documents type hints in third-party Python tools and in other languages.  

Radical or not, type hints are upon us: support for PEP 484 in the form of a typing module is likely to land in Python 3.5 already. The way the proposal is worded and implemented makes it clear that no existing code will stop running because of the lack of type hints—or their addition, for that matter.  

Finally, PEP 484 clearly states:  

`It should also be emphasized that Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory, even by convention.`

#### Is Python weakly typed?
Discussions about language typing disciplines are sometimes confused due to lack of a uniform terminology. Some writers (like Bill Venners in the interview with Guido mentioned in Further Reading), say that Python has weak typing, which puts it into the same category of JavaScript and PHP. A better way of talking about typing discipline is to consider two different axes:  

#### Strong versus weak typing
If the language rarely performs implicit conversion of types, it’s considered strongly typed; if it often does it, it’s weakly typed. Java, C++ and Python are strongly typed. PHP, JavaScript and Perl are weakly typed.  

#### Static versus dynamic typing
If type-checking is performed at compile time, the language is statically typed; it it happens at run-time, it’s dynamically typed. Static typing requires type declarations (some modern languages use type inference to avoid some of that). Fortran and Lisp are the two oldest programming languages still alive and they use, respectively, static and dynamic typing.  

Strong typing helps catch bugs early. Below are some examples of why weak typing is bad[104].  

```
// this is JavaScript (tested with Node.js v0.10.33)
'' == '0'   // false
0 == ''     // true
0 == '0'    // true
'' < 0      // false
'' < '0'    // true
```

Python does not perform automatic coercion between strings and numbers, so the == expressions above all result False—preserving the the transitivity of ==—and the < comparisons raise TypeError in Python 3.  

Static typing makes it easier for tools (compilers, IDEs) to analyze code to detect errors and provide other services (optimization, refactoring etc.). Dynamic typing increases opportunities for reuse, reducing line count, and allows interfaces to emerge naturally as protocols, instead of being imposed early on.  

To summarize, Python uses dynamic and strong typing. PEP 484 - Type Hints will not change that, but will allow API authors to add optional type annotations so that tools can perform some static type checking.  

#### Monkey patching 猴子补丁
Monkey patching has a bad reputation. If abused, it can lead to systems that are hard to understand and maintain. The patch is usually tightly coupled with its target, making it brittle. Another problem is that two libraries that apply monkey-patches may step on each other’s toes, with the second library to run destroying patches of the first.  

猴子补丁的名声很不好。因为，如果它被滥用的话，那将导致系统难以理解和维护。补丁通常与需要打补丁的目标之间是一种紧耦合的关系，这也意味着它很脆弱。另外一个问题是应用了猴子补丁的两个库会发生相互覆盖的情况，第二个库的运行将销毁第一个库的补丁。  

But monkey patching can also be useful, for example, to make a class implement a protocol at runtime. The adapter design pattern solves the same problem by implementing a whole new class.  

但是猴子补丁也是非常有用的，例如，让类在运行时实现协议。

It’s easy to monkey patch Python code, but there are limitations. Unlike Ruby and JavaScript, Python does not let you monkey patch the built-in types. I actually consider this an advantage, since you can be certain that a str object will always have those same methods. This limitation reduces the chance that external libraries try to apply conflicting patches.  

对Python的代码打补丁很容易，但也存在局限。不像Ruby和Javascript，Python不允许你对内建类型进行猴子补丁。我确实认为这是一个优点，因为

#### Interfaces in Java, Go and Ruby
#### Java,Go,和Ruby中的接口
Since C++ 2.0 (1989), abstract classes have been used to specify interfaces that language. The designers of Java opted not to have multiple inheritance of classes, which precluded the use of abstract classes as interface specifications—because often a class needs to implement more than one interface. But they added the interface as a language construct, and a class can implement more than one interface—a form of multiple inheritance. Making interface definitions more explicit than ever was a great contribution of Java. With Java 8, an interface can provide method implementations, called Default Methods. With this, Java interfaces became closer to abstract classes in C++ and Python.  

The Go language has a completely different approach. First of all, there is no inheritance in Go. You can define interfaces, but you don’t need (and you actually can’t) explicitly say that a certain type implements an interface. The compiler determines that automatically. So what they have in Go could be called “static duck typing”, in the sense that interfaces are checked at compile time but what matters is what types actually implement.  

Go语言拥有完全不同的方式。首先，在Go中不存在继承。你可以接口，但是

Compared to Python, it’s as if, in Go, every ABC implemented the `__subclasshook__ `checking function names and signatures, and you never subclassed or registered an ABC. If we wanted Python to look more like Go, we would have to perform type checks on all function arguments. Some of the infrastructure is available (recall Function annotations). Guido has already said he thinks it’s OK to use those annotations for type checking—at least in support tools. See Soapbox in Chapter 5 for more about this.  

相较于Python，假如在Go中每一个ABC都实现`__subclasshook__`以检查函数名称和签名，而用户从来就没有子类化ABC，后者注册一个ABC。假如我们想要Python看上去更像Go，我们必须对所有的函数参数执行类型检查。对于一些基础部分是可行的

Rubyists are firm believers in duck typing, and Ruby has no formal way to declare an interface or an abstract class, except to do the same we did in Python prior to 2.6: raise NotImplementedError in the body of methods to make them abstract by forcing the user to subclass and implement them.  

Meanwhile, I read that Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, creator of Ruby, said in a keynote in September, 2014, that static typing may be in the future of the language. That was at Ruby Kaigi in Japan, one of the most important Ruby conferences every year. As I write this I haven’t seen a transcript, but Godfrey Chan posted about it in his blog: Ruby Kaigi 2014: Day 2. From Chan’s report, it seems Matz focused on function annotations. There is even mention of Python function annotations.  

I wonder if function annotations would be really good without ABCs to add structure to the type system without losing flexibility. So maybe formal interfaces are also in the future of Ruby.  

I believe Python ABCs, with the register function and `__subclasshook__`, brought formal interfaces to the language without throwing away the advantages of dynamic typing.  

我相信使用了注册器函数和`__subclasshook__`的Python ABC，给这门语言带来的是正式的接口而且不用丢掉动态类型好处。  

Perhaps the geese are poised to overtake the ducks.  

可能，鹅随时准备赶超鸭子。  

#### Metaphors and idioms in interfaces  接口中的隐喻和习语
A metaphor fosters understanding by making constraints clear. That’s the value of the words “stack” and “queue” in describing those fundamental data structures: they make clear how items can be added or removed. On the other hand, Alan Cooper writes in About Face, 4e (Wiley, 2014):

`Strict adherence to metaphors ties interfaces unnecessarily tightly to the workings of the physical world.`

He’s referring to user interfaces, but the admonition applies to APIs as well. But Cooper does grant that when an “truly appropriate” metaphor “falls on our lap”, we can use it (he writes “falls on our lap” because it’s so hard to find fitting metaphors that you should not spend time actively looking for them). I believe the bingo machine imagery I used in this chapter is appropriate and I stand by it.  

About Face is by far the best book about UI design I’ve read—and I’ve read a few. Letting go of metaphors as a design paradigm, and replacing it with “idiomatic interfaces” was the most valuable thing I learned from Cooper’s work. As mentioned, Cooper does not deal with APIs, but the more I think about his ideas, the more I see they apply to Python. The fundamental protocols of the language are what Cooper calls “idioms”. Once we learn what a “sequence” is we can apply that knowledge in different contexts. This is a main theme of Fluent Python: highlighting the fundamental idioms of the language, so your code is concise, effective and readable—for a fluent Pythonista.

[86] Issue16518: add “buffer protocol” to glossary was actually resolved by replacing many mentions of “object that supports the buffer protocol/interface/API” with “bytes-like object”; a follow-up issue is Other mentions of the buffer protocol.  

[87] You can also, of course, define your own ABCs—but I would discourage all but the most advanced Pythonistas from going that route, just as I would discourage them from defining their own custom metaclasses… and even for said “most advanced Pythonistas”, those of us sporting deep mastery of every fold and crease in the language, these are not tools for frequent use: such “deep metaprogramming”, if ever appropriate, is intended for authors of broad frameworks meant to be independently extended by vast numbers of separate development teams… less than 1% of “most advanced Pythonistas” may ever need that!—A.M.  

[88] Unfortunately in Python 3.4 there is no ABC that helps distinguish a str from tuple or other immutable sequences, so we must test against str. In Python 2 the basestr type exists to help with tests like these. It’s not an ABC, but it’s a superclass of both str and unicode, but in Python 3 basestr is gone. Curiously, there is in Python 3 a collections.abc.ByteString type, but it only helps detecting bytes and bytearray.
